#  The History of Manchester City F.C.

Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England. The club was formed in 1880 as St. Mark's, before becoming Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1903. The club has played at the City of Manchester Stadium since 2003, having previously played at Maine Road from 1923 to 2003.

The club initially competed in the Lancashire League and the Football Alliance, before becoming a founding member of the Premier League in 1992. After winning their first major trophy—the League Cup in 2004—they finished first in the Premier League in 2012, only to be relegated one season later. They were then promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt.

In addition to their Premier League title win in 2018, they also have a number of domestic honours, including four FA Cups, six Football League Cups and two UEFA Cups Winners' Cups. The club also won the English championship twice in 1937 and 1968.

Manchester City F.C.'s roots stem from Ardwick A.F.C., which was founded as a cricket team in 1857 by John Connell and William Beastow.[1] Cricket continued to be played at the club until 1870, when football was introduced.[2] The club initially played matches against other football clubs from around Manchester,[3] but it was not until 1887 that they formally adopted the name Ardwick Association Football Club.[4] In 1892, they moved to Hyde Road.[5]

The team initially competed in the Lancashire League and the Football Alliance,[6] before becoming a founder member of the English Division Two (the second tier of English football) ahead of the 1890–91 season. In 1898, they moved again to Belle Vue,[7] before settling at Maine Road in 1923.[8]

In 1923, Manchester City were invited to become one of the twelve founder members of the new Third Division North of the Football League.[9] The invitation was accepted, and for much of their early years as a professional side they were closely associated with Yorkshire clubs such as Bradford Park Avenue (they once serviced an away fixture at Huddersfield Town on Christmas Day), Barnsley (whose ground they shared for four seasons) and Leeds United (against whom they contested an FA Cup semi-final tie). They remained in Division Two until 1965–66 season when they became champions under manager Joe Mercer – ironically beating Leeds United 5–1 on aggregate over two legs – and were promoted to Division One along with Liverpool (who would later replace Manchester City as England's most successful club). They narrowly avoided relegation back to Division Two during their first season back among "the big boys", but then promptly established themselves within English football's top tier over following campaigns; finishing fifth (1971–72), sixth (1972–73) and third (1973–74) respectively during three seasons before relegation finally did catch up with them during 1976-77 campaign after finishing 6th yet again 12 points adrift of champions Liverpool who additionally progressed into semi-finals European Cup Winners' Cup knocking out defending champions FC Bruges en route along with cup holders Bayern Munich so ending chances Mancunian side competing continental stage next season instead UEFA Cup where would had enter 3rd qualifying round meeting Valletta replacing Glasgow Rangers who crowned Scottish champions 1977 dethroning previous crowned English counterparts Liverpool considered by many observers as strongest side Europe up until mid seventies if didn't happen off pitch strife involving Brian Clough coming Oldham Athletic manager succeeding Mercer taking charge 2 years previous disastrous start costing him his job leaving Liverpool unchallenged dominant force outbreak hooliganismMarseille final 1st leg). They bounced straight back up however by winning Division Two at their first attempt under new manager Malcolm Allison – ironically also defeating Leeds United 5–1 on aggregate over two legs – scoring 101 goals along way including 8 consecutive home wins early part season propelling them into promotion pushing Chelsea all way .[10][11][12][13]
