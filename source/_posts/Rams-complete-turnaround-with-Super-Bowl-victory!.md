#  Rams complete turnaround with Super Bowl victory!

What a turnaround it has been for the Los Angeles Rams. Just three seasons ago, they were one of the worst teams in the NFL. After a dismal 4-12 season in 2016, the Rams completely turned things around in 2017, winning the NFC West and advancing to the Super Bowl.

The playoff run started with a dramatic 26-23 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in the Wild Card round. The Rams then upset the top-seeded New Orleans Saints with a 26-23 overtime win in the Divisional round. In the NFC Championship game, they stunned the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings with a 38-7 victory.

This impressive turnaround was due, in part, to new head coach Sean McVay. At just 33 years old, he became the youngest head coach in NFL history when he was hired by the Rams prior to the 2017 season. McVay’s offensive acumen was on full display during this year’s playoff run, as his team averaged 34 points per game.

Super Bowl LIII was a defensive battle, as the Rams held the New England Patriots to just three points. This low score was due, in part, to the fact that both teams’ offenses were stymied by stout defenses. But when it mattered most,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein nailed a 57-yard field goal as time expired to give his team a 13-3 victory and its first Super Bowl championship since 2001.

#  Historic win for Rams - first Super Bowl championship in LA!

In a thrilling game which went down to the wire, the Los Angeles Rams have emerged victorious over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII. This is the first time that the Rams have won a Super Bowl championship, and it is also the first time that a team from Los Angeles has won the NFL’s biggest prize.

It was an eventful game, with both teams scoring just three points in the first half. The Rams then took control in the second half, but were unable to pull away from the Patriots. In the end, it came down to a last-minute field goal attempt by Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski, which would have tied the game at 17-17. However, Gostkowski’s kick was blocked, and the Rams held on for a 20-17 victory.

Rams quarterback Jared Goff was named MVP of the game, throwing for 229 yards and a touchdown. He was helped out by running back Todd Gurley, who ran for 108 yards and another touchdown. For New England, quarterback Tom Brady threw for 262 yards but no touchdowns, and was held sackless for only the second time this season.

This was an exciting end to what has been a tumultuous season for both teams. The Rams were one of several teams which made a coaching change during the season, firing Jeff Fisher and replacing him with Sean McVay - who is just 31 years old and is now head coach of the youngest team in NFL history. The Patriots meanwhile were rocked by allegations of cheating, after it was revealed that they had videotaped opposing coaches’ signals during games.

Nevertheless, both teams battled their way through to make it to Super Bowl LIII, and in the end it was the Rams who came out on top. This is an historic win for Los Angeles football fans, who have waited many years for their team to bring home a championship trophy.

#  Goff leads Rams to unlikely Super Bowl victory over Patriots

In a matchup that was heavily anticipated by football fans all over the globe, the Los Angeles Rams narrowly defeated the New England Patriots in Atlanta, 13-3. This was a great upset victory for Sean McVay’s young Rams squad, as they were considered underdogs coming into the game.

The MVP of the game was undoubtedly Jared Goff, who completed 19 of 38 passes for 229 yards and one touchdown. He played an excellent game against a tough New England defense, leading his team to victory in the final moments.

This was an especially sweet victory for Goff, who had been criticized heavily in recent years and was seen by many as a bust. He has now firmly established himself as one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL, and will likely be one of the favorites to win MVP next season.

The Rams defense also played a major role in this victory, shutting down Tom Brady and the New England offense for most of the game. The only touchdown scored by the Patriots came late in the fourth quarter, when it was already too late.

Overall, it was an impressive team performance by the Rams, who proved that they are a force to be reckoned with in the coming years.

#  Rams shock the world, upset Patriots to win Super Bowl

In one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, the Rams shocked the world by upsetting the Patriots 13-3.

The Rams got off to a hot start, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. The Patriots responded with a field goal, but they were unable to score again the rest of the game.

The Rams defense was dominant, shutting down Tom Brady and the Patriots offense. Jared Goff had a very efficient game, completing 18 of 26 passes for 229 yards and one touchdown.

 Todd Gurley was also a major factor for the Rams, running for 105 yards and one touchdown on 20 carries.

With this win, the Rams have finally put their Super Bowl drought to bed.
