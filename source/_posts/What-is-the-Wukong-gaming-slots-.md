The Wukong game is a simple, two-player game that can be played with dominos or coins. Each player starts with six coins or dominoes, and the aim of the game is to remove all of the opponent's pieces.

The game is played in a turn-based manner, and each player can either move one of their pieces, or alternatively swap two pieces. The following rules apply:

* A piece can only be moved if it is next to an opponent's piece.

* A piece cannot move if it would leave the board.

* A piece can be swapped with another piece if it is adjacent to it.

The first player to lose all of their pieces loses the game.
