#  Mariners Sweep Athletics In Series To Boost Playoff Hopes

Entering their four-game series against the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners fans were cautiously optimistic. The team had been on a bit of a skid as they attempted to hold onto their slim playoff hopes. After dropping the first game of the series 2-1, the Mariners rallied to sweep their American League West rivals in impressive fashion.

The offense got going in game two, scoring six runs on 11 hits en route to an 8-2 victory. Robinson Cano led the way with three hits and three RBIs, while Nelson Cruz added two hits and two RBIs of his own. Game three saw the Mariners bats continue to roar, as they scored eight runs on 11 hits in a 8-3 victory. Again, Cruz led the way with three hits and three RBIs. The sweep was capped off by another high-scoring affair in game four, as the Mariners put up five runs on nine hits in a 5-4 win. This time it was shortstop Jean Segura who led the way with three hits and one RBI.

The sweep allowed Seattle to pull within 1.5 games of the Minnesota Twins for the second wild card spot in the American League. There are still plenty of hurdles for the Mariners to overcome, but this series proves that they are capable of playing with anyone in baseball when they are firing on all cylinders.

#  Nelson Cruz Hits 41st Homer As Mariners Top Twins

Cruz led off the fourth inning with his 41st homer of the season, a solo shot to center field off Twins starter Jose Berrios (10-8). That gives him six seasons with 40 or more homers, second only to Alex Rodriguez (seven).

Only Giancarlo Stanton (44) and Khris Davis (43) have hit more home runs this season than Cruz.

"It feels really good," Cruz said. "It's been a while since I've been able to play in the postseason, so hopefully we can make it happen."

Cruz is one of only four players in Major League Baseball history with at least six seasons of 40 or more home runs, joining A-Rod, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds.

The Mariners went on to win the game 7-4, sweeping the three-game series from the Twins and improving their record to 73-59 on the year. Seattle is now just 1.5 games back of Oakland for the second wild card spot in the American League.

#  Ichiro Suzuki Hits 3,000th Hit In Win Over Blue Jays

Ichiro Suzuki became just the 30th player in baseball history to reach 3,000 hits with a triple off Toronto starter R.A. Dickey in the first inning of Wednesday's victory over the Blue Jays.

"It's an amazing accomplishment," Mariners manager Scott Servais said after Seattle's 5-4 win. "He's done it the right way. He's very humble about it. The way he carries himself on and off the field is really something special."

Suzuki, 42, is a .314 career hitter and has won 10 batting titles. His milestone moment came in his 4,272nd game, and he was mobbed by his teammates after crossing home plate.

In typical Ichiro fashion, he downplayed the achievement after the game. "It happened today but I'm still just as wrong tomorrow as I am today," Suzuki said through an interpreter. "I don't think this changes anything."

#  Felix Hernandez Pitches Gem As Mariners Shut Out Rangers

SEATTLE (AP) — Felix Hernandez pitched seven innings of three-hit ball and the Seattle Mariners shut out the Texas Rangers 3-0 on Tuesday night.

Nelson Cruz hit his team-leading 20th homer in the fourth inning and Robinson Cano drove in two runs with a double in the fifth as the Mariners (47-47) snapped a three-game losing streak.

Hernandez (10-4) struck out six and walked one in his second complete game of the season. The right-hander has not allowed an earned run in his last 21 innings.

"Félix was really sharp tonight," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "He had all his pitches going."

Rangers starter A.J. Griffin (5-7) allowed three runs on six hits over 4 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked two.

"It was just one of those nights where I couldn't find my rhythm," Griffin said. "I left some balls up in the zone and they made me pay for it."

The Rangers have lost five of their last six games and are 2 1/2 games behind first-place Houston in the American League West.

Cano's double off reliever Alex Claudio glanced off the glove of leaping third baseman Joey Gallo and bounced into left field, scoring Jean Segura from first base. Cano then scored on a wild pitch by Claudio to give Seattle a 3-0 lead.

#  James Paxton Throws Complete Game Shutout, Mariners Win 7-0

The Seattle Mariners had James Paxton on the mound for the final game of their series against the Houston Astros. Paxton pitched a complete game shutout, giving up only four hits and striking out 10 batters. The Mariners won the game 7-0, putting them in sole possession of first place in the AL West.

Paxton was dominant throughout the game, never allowing the Astros to get into a groove. He struck out the side in the third inning and got José Altuve to fly out to end the game.

"I felt like I had good command of all my pitches tonight," Paxton said after the game. "I was able to keep them off balance and make them hit weak ground balls."

The Mariners' lineup also came through for Paxton, scoring seven runs on 11 hits. Dee Gordon led the way with three hits, including a solo home run in the sixth inning that gave the Mariners a 6-0 lead. Nelson Cruz and Mitch Haniger also had two hits apiece.

It was a big win for the Mariners, who have been struggling lately but now have a five-game lead over the Astros in the AL West. Paxton has been one of their best pitchers this season, and he showed why on Wednesday night.
