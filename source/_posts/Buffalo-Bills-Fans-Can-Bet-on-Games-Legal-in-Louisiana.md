#  Buffalo Bills Fans Can Bet on Games Legal in Louisiana

The Buffalo Bills have a passionate and engaged fan base, who will do anything to see their team win. In the state of Louisiana, residents will now be able to place bets on Bills games at the local casino or race track.

While some may worry that this could lead to more gambling addiction, it is important to remember that this is a legal activity. And for Bills fans in Louisiana, it provides an extra way to support their favorite team.

Gambling on sports is nothing new – it has been happening since the early days of organized sports. But with the growth of online betting, it has become even more popular in recent years.

Fans can now place bets on games through their smartphones or computers, from anywhere in the world. This has led to some controversies, as well as some huge payouts.

For example, in 2014 an online sports gambler won $11 million by betting on several college football games. And just last year, a British man won $1.4 million by betting on NFL games.

Clearly there is money to be made by betting on sports games. But for most fans, the main reason to bet is simply because they want their team to win.

And for Bills fans in Louisiana, this new law provides another way to support their favorite team.

#  Buffalo Bills Now Legal to Bet on in Louisiana

A new sports betting bill in Louisiana has the Buffalo Bills as one of the new legal bets available in the state. The move opens up a host of other NFL teams to legal bets, including the Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, New England Patriots (of course), New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks.

Louisiana residents will now also be able to place bets on college games as well as professional games. The law also allows for betting on baseball and basketball games.

The Buffalo Bills have had a bit of a resurgence in recent years and it will be interesting to see how this new development impacts the team’s odds heading into the 2019-2020 season.

#  Las Vegas Odds Show Buffalo Bills as Favorites for First Time

The Buffalo Bills are set as favorites for the first time in the franchise's history, according to the latest odds from Las Vegas.

At 3-1, the Bills have the third-best odds to win Super Bowl LII, trailing only the New England Patriots (7-2) and Pittsburgh Steelers (4-1).

Buffalo has not been a favorite in any game since 2002, when they were listed as 2.5-point favorites over the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bills lost that game 20-13.

The team finished last season with a 7-9 record and enters this year with a new head coach in Sean McDermott and plenty of question marks.

One thing is for sure: fans in Buffalo are excited about their team's chances for the first time in a long time.

#  Bills Hoping to Bring Gambling Winnings Home to Louisiana

Gamblers in Louisiana may soon be able to spend their winnings in the state, as lawmakers look to pass a bill allowing casinos to operate there. The bill, which is awaiting a vote by the full House of Representatives, would allow for up to 15 casino licenses in the state.

The proposal has broad bipartisan support, with backers saying it would bring much-needed revenue to the state. Louisiana has been hit hard by falling oil prices, and Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) has said he supports the measure.

“HBond 853 will create good jobs, attract new businesses and increase tourism in our state,” Edwards said in a statement.

Opponents of the measure say it will lead to more gambling addiction and social ills, but supporters argue that such problems are already present in the state and will not be made worse by the bill.

If passed, the law would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2019.

#  Buffalo Bills Now Legally Wagering in the State of Louisiana

The Buffalo Bills have announced they will now be legally wagering in the state of Louisiana. The team has partnered with Harrah's New Orleans to offer a variety of gambling options, including betting on NFL games.

"We're excited to partner with Harrah's New Orleans and offer our fans another way to enjoy Bills games," said team CEO Russ Brandon. "This partnership provides us with an opportunity to engage with our fans in an exciting new environment."

Bills fans can now place bets on Sunday games at the casino, as well as play in fantasy football leagues and participate in other promotions related to the team.

This is the first time the Bills have offered legal gambling options on their games. In the past, fans could only bet on games illegally. It's not clear yet if the team will partner with casinos in other states.
