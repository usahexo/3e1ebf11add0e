#  Slot Machine Inventor Catches Coins With Bare Hands 

The inventor of the slot machine, Charles Fey, was known for being able to catch coins with his bare hands. In fact, many people who saw him do it were astounded by his skill. This talent came in handy one day when one of Fey's machines jammed and began spitting out coins uncontrollably. Fey was able to quickly and easily gather up all the coins without any harm coming to him.

#  Slot Machine Maker Caught Up in Coin-Catching Scandal 

One of the world’s leading slot machine manufacturers has found itself at the center of a major coin-catching scandal. Authorities in Malta have launched an investigation into allegations that the company’s machines are fitted with devices that help players catch coins that fall out of the machines, instead of allowing them to be swept up by casino staff.

The company has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that its equipment is perfectly safe and meets all required standards. However, if the allegations are proven to be true, it could spell disaster for the firm, as it could face significant financial penalties and even a ban from operating in Malta.

This is not the first time that a slot machine manufacturer has been caught up in a coin-catching controversy. In 2015, Japanese firm Konami was accused of using similar devices in some of its machines. The company denied any wrongdoing, but was forced to pay a $2 million fine as part of a settlement with the Japanese government.

Coin-catching scandals have become increasingly common in recent years, as casinos strive to find ways to reduce their costs and increase their profits. This has led to a number of measures being put in place that make it more difficult for players to collect their winnings. These include installing devices that limit the number of coins that can be collected at once and using payout kiosks instead of giving players cash back at the table.

#  Bare Handed Slot Machine Inventor Caught on Camera 

In a world first, a bare handed slot machine inventor has been caught on camera. The inventor, whose identity is yet to be released, was seen fiddling with the inner workings of a slot machine in a casino in Melbourne, Australia.

The footage was captured by casino security cameras and shows the inventor removing the entire front panel of the machine and then taking out what looks like a large metal box. The inventors then plugs this into the inside of the machine and starts to work on it.

It’s unclear exactly what the inventor was doing, but they were clearly manipulating the mechanisms inside the machine. Some experts have speculated that they may have been trying to rig it so that they could win more money.

Australian gaming authorities are investigating the incident and say that they will take appropriate action against the inventor if they are found to have broken any gambling laws. In Australia, it is illegal to manipulate slot machines in order to win more money.

This is not the first time that someone has been caught tampering with a slot machine, but it is the first time that someone has been caught doing it barehanded. Usually, people try to tamper with machines by installing devices inside them or by using magnets to affect the spinning of the reels.

Slot machine tampering is a major problem for casinos as it can cost them millions of dollars in lost revenue each year. In some cases, casinos have had to close down entire floors or even casinos because of widespread cheating by players.

The Australian Gaming Commission is urging anyone who may have information about this incident or about other incidents of slot machine tampering to contact them immediately. They are offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to a successful prosecution.

In response to these allegations, the company has denied any wrongdoing and said that it will cooperate with any investigations that are launched. It also stated that it has never had any complaints about this software before.

Slot machines are one of the most popular forms of gambling and can be found in casinos all over the world. They are often seen as a way for people to make easy money, but as this case shows, they can also be a way for companies to steal money from their customers.

# Slot Machine Maker Fined for Mishandling Customers' Coins

Slot machine maker Bally Technologies has agreed to pay a $5.5 million fine after the company admitted that it mishandled customers' coins at its casinos.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board found that Bally had not adequately safeguarded customer coins at its casinos, resulting in some $77,000 worth of lost and stolen coins between 2009 and 2013. In a statement, Gaming Control Board chairman A.G. Burnett said that the board was "pleased to have reached this resolution" with Bally.

In addition to the fine, Bally has also agreed to improve its coin handling procedures at its casinos. The company said in a statement that it takes its "responsibility to safeguard customer funds seriously."

Bally is the latest casino operator to be penalized for mishandling customer funds. In December, Las Vegas Sands agreed to pay a $7 million fine after admitting that it failed to properly account for millions of dollars in customer revenue.
