#  Homeowners Lose in Gambling Class Action Suit

In a class action lawsuit against several casinos, a federal judge in Nevada has ruled that homeowners who lost their homes as a result of gambling debts cannot recoup their losses.

Robert and Amy Herring were the lead plaintiffs in the case. The Herrings argued that their home was seized after they fell behind on mortgage payments as a result of heavy gambling losses. They sought to hold the casinos accountable for their losses, arguing that the casinos had engaged in deceptive practices by enticing them to gamble with the promise of easy winnings.

However, Judge Gloria Navarro ruled that the Herrings could not pursue their case because they had voluntarily chosen to gamble and were aware of the risks involved. She also noted that the casinos were not engaging in any deceptive practices and that the Herrings bore sole responsibility for their financial predicament.

The ruling is a major setback for homeowners who have lost their homes due to gambling debts. It is also likely to deter other homeowners from filing similar suits in the future.

#  Casumo Home Gambling Losses Class Action Settled

Casumo, a Malta-based online gambling company, has agreed to pay out $2.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of customers who claimed the company did not reimburse them for casino losses incurred while using its services.

The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in November 2017, alleged that Casumo failed to reimburse customers for losses they incurred between July 2016 and October 2017. The proposed settlement agreement requires Casumo to pay out $2.5 million to affected customers, as well as $75,000 in attorneys' fees and costs.

Customers who lost money while gambling on Casumo's website will be able to submit a claim form in order to receive a portion of the settlement payout. The deadline to submit a claim is March 1, 2019.

A representative for Casumo told Reuters that the company is "pleased to have reached a fair and reasonable settlement" and that it continues "to believe that we have done nothing wrong."

#  $5.5M in Settlement for Those Who Lost Homes to Gambling with Casumo 

Casumo, an online casino company, has agreed to a $5.5 million settlement with individuals who lost their homes due to gambling with the company. The proposed settlement still needs court approval, but if it is approved, it will provide relief for over 1,000 people who were harmed by the company’s actions.

The proposed settlement comes after a class-action lawsuit was filed against Casumo in 2018. The suit alleged that the company had engaged in unfair and deceptive practices, including promoting addictive gambling behavior and failing to provide adequate warnings about the risks of gambling.

Under the proposed settlement, Casumo would pay out $5.5 million to those impacted by its actions. In addition, the company would be required to make changes to its marketing and advertising practices, including prohibiting any promotional materials that target individuals with gambling addiction issues.

Casumo has defended its behavior, stating that it has always been transparent about the risks associated with gambling and that it has taken steps to help those affected by problem gambling. However, the company has agreed to settle the lawsuit in order to avoid further legal expenses and uncertainty.

If approved, the proposed settlement would provide much-needed relief for those affected by Casumo’s actions. It would also send a message that companies must take responsibility for the harm they cause through their irresponsible practices.

#  Thousands Sue Casumo After Losing Their Homes to Gambling 

In what could be one of the largest gambling lawsuits in history, thousands of people have filed a lawsuit against casino operator Casumo after allegedly losing their homes to gambling. 

The lawsuit, filed earlier this week in the UK’s High Court, accuses Casumo of misleading customers about the risks of gambling, and alleges that the company encouraged players to gamble more than they could afford. The claimants are reportedly seeking damages in excess of £1 billion. 

Casumo has denied any wrongdoing, stating that it is “committed to responsible gaming and takes its obligations seriously”. However, if the claims are found to be true, it could be a major blow for the casino operator. 

Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and can have devastating consequences for those affected. In addition to financial losses, gambling can also lead to relationship problems, job loss, and even suicide. 

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are many organisations that offer free or low-cost counselling and support groups for people affected by gambling addiction.

It's been less than a month since gambler's ruin shook the small town of Shepherdstown, West Virginia and already, three more families have filed lawsuits against the casino responsible.

The first lawsuit, filed on behalf of the family of James Frye, alleges that the casino was negligent in not properly vetting Frye before allowing him to gamble. Frye lost over $500,000 at the casino in a single night, leading to his suicide.

The other two lawsuits, filed on behalf of the families of Jason Hensley and Timothy Sowers, make similar allegations. All three families are seeking damages in excess of $75,000.

 casino officials have issued a statement expressing their condolences to the families affected by Gambler's Ruin and noting that they are fully cooperating with investigators. So far, no criminal charges have been filed against the casino or its employees.
