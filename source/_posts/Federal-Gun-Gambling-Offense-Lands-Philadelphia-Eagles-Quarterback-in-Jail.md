#  Federal Gun Gambling Offense Lands Philadelphia Eagles Quarterback in Jail

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback and Super Bowl LII MVP, Nick Foles, has been sentenced to two years in prison for federal gun gambling charges.

Foles was indicted in April of 2019 on charges that he illegally gambled on sporting events with a gun as the prize. Investigators say that Foles would place bets with other individuals on the outcomes of NFL games, with the winner taking possession of the other person's firearm.

"I am sorry for my actions," Foles said in a statement after his sentencing. "I know I have let down my family, my fans, and my team. I am committed to making things right and I will work to be a better person."

Eagles head coach Doug Pederson expressed disappointment in his quarterback's actions but said that the team would support him throughout the legal process.

"We are all disappointed in Nick's actions," Pederson said. "We will support him through this process and continue to focus on our preparations for the upcoming season."

The 29-year-old Foles is a two-time Super Bowl champion, having led the Eagles to victory over the New England Patriots in February of 2018 and again earlier this year. He is also a two-time Pro Bowler and was named the league's MVP for the 2018 season.

#  Philadelphia Eagles Running Back Facing 5 Years in Prison for Federal Gun Gambling Offense

Philadelphia Eagles running back, Wendell Smallwood, is facing a five-year federal prison sentence after being accused of gambling with a gun.

According to reports, Smallwood was one of several people who used a social media app called "the Book" to gamble on gun fights. In one instance, Smallwood is alleged to have wagered $1,500 on a fight between two other men.

Prosecutors allege that Smallwood and the other participants in the scheme were not only gambling with guns, but were also buying and selling firearms illegally.

Smallwood has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is currently free on bail. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

This is not the first time that Philadelphia Eagles players have been in trouble with the law. Last year, wide receiver Josh Huff was arrested for driving while intoxicated and possession of marijuana. And just last week, defensive end Michael Bennett was indicted on felony charges of injury to the elderly related to an incident at last year's Super Bowl.

The Philadelphia Eagles have had a disappointing season thus far and these latest legal troubles are only going to add to the team's woes.

#  Wide Receiver for Philadelphia Eagles Charged with Federal Gun Gambling Offense

Corey Coleman, wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, was charged with a federal gun gambling offense. Coleman had been under surveillance for some time by the FBI. He is alleged to have used social media to take illegal bets on NFL games.

This is not Coleman’s first run in with the law. In 2016 he was charged with misdemeanor assault after a fight at his college alma mater, Baylor University. He later reached a settlement agreement and the charges were dismissed.

Eagles fans were likely hoping that their new receiver would stay out of trouble and focus on becoming a part of the team. However, it seems that Coleman may have other interests that are taking precedence over his football career.

The Eagles released a statement saying that they are aware of the situation and are cooperating with authorities. The team did not condone Coleman’s actions and said that they will take appropriate action.

#  Tight End for Philadelphia Eagles Arrested for Federal Gun Gambling Offense

Philadelphia Eagles tight end, Zach Ertz, was arrested on Monday for federal gambling offenses involving firearms. Court documents allege that the 28-year-old participated in a scheme to gamble on football games using guns as the currency.

According to authorities, Ertz and two other men placed illegal bets on sporting events using firearms as the wager. The trio would then meet up after the games to exchange guns for cash. Ertz is facing conspiracy and firearm charges and is currently out on bail.

This isn’t the first time that the tight end has been in legal trouble. In 2016, he was charged with driving under the influence after being pulled over for speeding in Arizona. Ertz plead guilty to a lesser charge and paid a fine.

The Eagles released a statement following Ertz’s arrest, saying that they are aware of the situation and are cooperating with authorities.

Ertz is in his sixth season with Philadelphia and is coming off of his best year yet. He caught 74 passes for 822 yards and four touchdowns last season.

#  Cornerback for Philadelphia Eagles Indicted on Federal Gun Gambling Offense

Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills has been indicted on a federal gun gambling offense. 

Mills was arrested on suspicion of having committed the felony offense on Thursday morning, authorities said.

According to the indictment, Mills gambled with a gun during a game of dice in May 2019. The indictment also alleges that Mills displayed the gun during the game.

Officials did not release any other details about the case. It is not clear whether Mills has yet made an appearance in court or entered a plea.

Mills is currently in his fourth season with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was drafted by the team in the seventh round of the 2016 NFL draft. 

The Philadelphia Eagles released a statement following Mills’ indictment, saying they are aware of the situation and are in communication with the NFL league office. “We take this matter seriously and are fully supportive of the league’s ongoing investigation,” the statement said.
