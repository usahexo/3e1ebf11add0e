#  Man Who Bet Almost All of His Money on Manchester City FC Wins Big

A man who put almost all of his money on Manchester City FC to win the English Premier League (EPL) title this season has won big, according to reports.

The unidentified gambler placed a £200,000 ($264,000) bet on Man City in early February and watched as the team went on to win the league with five games to spare.

The winnings are believed to be worth around £500,000 ($660,000), meaning the man has made a healthy profit on his investment.

It’s not clear whether or not the gambler will pocket all of the money himself or if he will share it with others who also backed Man City.

The news comes as a timely boost for those who backed Pep Guardiola’s side, as they had been facing off against some stiff competition from Liverpool FC in recent weeks.

Liverpool had been leading the league for much of the season but a slip-up in their last few games allowed Man City to overtake them and clinch the title.



Manchester City’s dominant performance in the EPL this season has come as something of a surprise to many observers, who had written them off after they finished third last year.

Pep Guardiola’s side have now won back-to-back titles, having also won the Premier League in 2017/18.

#  Man's Roulette Gamble Pays Off With Manchester City Victory

A late goal by Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus gave the English Premier League leaders a hard-fought 3-2 victory over second-placed Liverpool on Sunday, January 14.

The result means that Manchester City have opened up an 11-point lead at the top of the table, and they now look all but certain to win their first Premier League title since 2014.

Liverpool, who have now lost four league games in a row, will be bitterly disappointed with the result. They had looked the better side for much of the game and took a 2-1 lead in the second half through goals from Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah.

However, Manchester City staged a late comeback to take all three points, with goals from Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus in the last 10 minutes. The win was especially important for Pep Guardiola's side as it came ahead of two difficult away fixtures against Everton and Newcastle United.

Manchester City now have 62 points from 23 games, while Liverpool have 51 points from 24 games.

#  roulette bet leads to big win for manchester city f.c. fan

Manchester City Football Club, also known as Man City, is a professional football club based in Manchester, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football.

City were founded in 1880 as St. Mark's West Gorton. They became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club has played at the City of Manchester Stadium since 2003, having played at Maine Road from 1923 to 2003.

The club has won the League Championship three times (1936, 1967 and 2012), the FA Cup five times (1904, 1934, 1956, 1969 and 2011), the League Cup twice (1970 and 1976), and the European Cup Winners' Cup once (1970).

A Manchester City supporter going by the name of "John" hit the headlines this week after winning £128,000 ($163,000) from a £10 ($13) bet on his team to win their last league game against Leicester City. John had put his money on a roulette table with odds of 66-1 that Man City would win - and was rewarded when they triumphed 5-1.

Speaking to reporters after his big win, John said: "I'm absolutely made up - it's life-changing money for me. I've been a Man City fan all my life and never thought I'd ever see them win the Premier League - let alone make such a big profit on a bet."

While some may question John's judgement in gambling so much on such an uncertain outcome, there can be no doubt that he is now feeling pretty happy with himself!
