#  Check the Goalie Stick!

It's no secret that goaltenders are some of the most important players on the ice. Their skills and performance can mean the difference between a victory and a defeat. That's why it's so important for goaltenders to have the best possible equipment, including a quality goalie stick.

There are many different factors to consider when choosing a goalie stick. The most important consideration is the goaltender's size and weight. A goalie stick should be heavy enough to provide stability and power, but not so heavy that it becomes difficult to control.

Another important factor is the flexibility of the goalie stick. A flexible stick will help absorb recoil from shots, making it less likely for the puck to bounce off the goalie's pads or body.

Finally, goaltenders should consider the curve of their goalie stick. A curved goalie stick will help deflect shots away from the net.

When shopping for a new goalie stick, be sure to try out several different models and find one that feels comfortable and easy to use. With the right equipment, any goaltender can achieve success on the ice!

#  Look for Teammate's Position on the Ice

Looking for a teammate’s position on the ice can be a daunting task. Especially if you are not familiar with the game of ice hockey. In this article, we will provide some tips to help you find your teammate’s position on the ice.

The first thing that you need to do is identify your teammates. This can be done by looking for players who are wearing identifying clothing or patches. Once you have identified your teammates, you need to locate them on the ice. This can be done by looking at the rink diagram or watching the game from above.

Once you have located your teammates, it is important to know their positions. Each position on the ice has a specific role that they play. Forwards are responsible for scoring goals, defensemen are responsible for preventing goals, and goaltenders are responsible for stopping shots.

Knowing your teammates’ positions will help you to better understand the game of ice hockey. It will also make it easier to find your teammates on the ice and help them to achieve their team’s objectives.

#  Check How the Puck is Deflected

Off the ice, hockey pucks are stored in a temperature-controlled environment. The puck is placed in a refrigerated area (-5 degrees Celsius) and then transferred to an area where the temperature is about 22 degrees Celsius before the game.

The Ideal Storage Temperature for a Hockey Puck

A study published in the "Journal of Sports Science and Medicine" found that the storage temperature of a hockey puck had a significant impact on its rebound characteristics. In the study, researchers looked at how different storage temperatures impacted the rebound height, velocity and distance of a hockey puck.

The study found that when the puck was stored at -5 degrees Celsius, it had a rebound height of 9.47 cm, rebound velocity of 47.38 m/s and rebound distance of 6.71 m. However, when the puck was stored at 22 degrees Celsius, it had a rebound height of only 7.48 cm, rebound velocity of 38.42 m/s and rebound distance of 5.05 m.

Based on these results, it's clear that storing the puck at -5 degrees Celsius results in better rebound characteristics than storing it at 22 degrees Celsius. This is likely due to the fact that when the puck is stored at -5 degrees Celsius, it is more dense than when it is stored at 22 degrees Celsius. As a result, it takes more energy to move the puck and this energy is released upon impact with the boards or goalie, resulting in a higher rebound height, velocity and distance.

#  Goalie's Height & Weight

Goalkeepers are typically around six-foot-four or six-foot-five. Some goalkeepers can be as short as five-foot-ten, but they are rare. Goalkeepers also weigh more than field players, with many averaging around 200 pounds. This extreme weight and height can sometimes seem like a disadvantage during fast breaks and corner kicks when the ball is in the air for only a few seconds, but their size often intimidates shooters.

Most of the taller goalkeepers began their careers as strikers or midfielders before being moved back to save balls in the net. shorter keepers are usually good at reacting quickly to stop goals. There are many different techniques to becoming a successful goalie, and various coaches prefer different players for their own unique strategies. With experience, these athletes learn how to use their size to their advantage by positioning themselves between the ball and the net.

#  Previous Statistics

In the previous article, we looked at some basic statistics of the Ethereum network. We found that:

- The average block time was 15 seconds.
- The average gas usage was 2.5 million.
- There were about 9,500 transactions per block.
- The average transaction fee was 0.00002 ETH.

Today, we will continue our analysis of the Ethereum network by looking at the distribution of transactions by fee.

# Ethereum Transaction Fees

The average transaction fee in Ethereum is 0.00002 ETH. However, this value varies significantly depending on the amount of gas used by a transaction. As shown in the following figure, less than 1% of transactions have a fee of more than 0.001 ETH:

This distribution is not surprising since fees are only charged when a transaction exceeds the gas limit set by the sender. As a result, most transactions do not incur any fees.
