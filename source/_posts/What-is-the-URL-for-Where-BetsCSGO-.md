#  Is Carolina Panthers a good team? 

There is no definite answer to whether or not the Carolina Panthers are a good team. Some people believe they are, while others think they still have some work to do. The Panthers had an up-and-down season in 2016, which could be indicative of whether or not they are destined for greatness this year.

One of the main reasons the Carolina Panthers may have had an inconsistent season last year was due to their lack of rushing attack. This year, the team made a few key acquisitions on the offensive line, which should help improve their performance in this area. Additionally, Christian McCaffrey was drafted by the Panthers in April and is anticipated to make a big impact as a rookie running back. Carolina’s offense should be much more potent this season, which will help them win more games.

On the defensive side of the ball, Carolina has some talented players who are capable of making big plays. Star linebacker Luke Kuechly is one such player who is always around the ball and makes a lot of tackles. His presence alone can help intimidate opponents and give Carolina an edge on defense.

Although there are some good players on the Panthers roster, they will need to play well as a team if they want to make it deep into the playoffs this year. If everyone can buy into Coach Ron Rivera’s system and execute properly, then Carolina has a good chance of being successful in 2017.
