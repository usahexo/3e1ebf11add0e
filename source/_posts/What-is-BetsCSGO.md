#  What is Nauru?

Officially known as the Republic of Nauru, Nauru is an island country located in the Central Pacific. The country consists of a single coral atoll with a surface area of just 21 square kilometers. Nauru has a population of just over 10,000 people, most of whom live in the capital city of Yaren.

Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian people over 3,000 years ago. The first European visitors arrived in the 18th century, and the island was claimed by Germany in 1888. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 1949, the British withdrew from their responsibilities and Nauru became an independent republic.

Since independence, Nauru has faced many challenges. The economy is highly dependent on phosphate mining, which has led to environmental degradation and economic instability. The government has also faced allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. In recent years, Nauru has become a major destination for refugees fleeing conflict and persecution.
