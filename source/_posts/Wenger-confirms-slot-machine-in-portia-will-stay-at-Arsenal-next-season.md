#  Wenger confirms slot machine in portia will stay at Arsenal next season

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has confirmed that the club’s slot machine in portia will remain at the Emirates Stadium for the upcoming season. The decision comes after a frustrating campaign in which the Gunners finished in fifth place in the Premier League, meaning they will not be playing in Europe’s premier competition next term.

The decision to keep the machine will no doubt come as a relief to Arsenal fans, who have been enjoying regular wins from the device over recent seasons. The slot machine in portia was first introduced to the club by former manager George Graham back in 1992 and has been a fixture at the Emirates ever since.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Wenger said: “I can confirm that the slot machine in portia will be staying at Arsenal next season. We had a disappointing campaign this year, but I believe that we can bounce back and make it back into Europe’s top competition. The slot machine in portia has been a big part of our success over recent years and I’m sure it will help us get back to where we belong.”

Arsenal are due to kick off their new season on August 11th when they take on newly-promoted Cardiff City at home.

#  Kroenke tight-lipped over slot machine in portia future

The future of the Portia casino is up in the air, as owner Stan Kroenke remains tight-lipped about his plans for the property.

Kroenke has been tight-lipped about his plans for the Portia casino since he purchased it from former owner Calvin Ayre in January. The casino has seen a decline in business since its purchase, with some employees reporting that they have not been paid in months.

When asked about his plans for the casino, Kroenke refused to comment, saying only that he is "studying the situation." Some industry experts believe that Kroenke may be planning to install slot machines at the casino, which would likely lead to a decline in business.

A spokesman for the Pueblo of Santa Ana, which operates the nearby Santa Ana Pueblo Casino, said that the tribe is "closely monitoring" Kroenke's plans for the Portia casino. The Santa Ana Pueblo Casino does not currently offer slot machines, and tribal officials are concerned that Kroenke's installation of slots at the Portia casino would put them at a competitive disadvantage.

Kroenke has not commented on reports that he is considering installing slot machines at the Portia casino.

#  Arsenal legend urges club to keep slot machine in portia

Arsenal legend Tony Adams has urged the club to keep Spanish forward Lucas Perez in the summer transfer window.

Adams, who is now the club's assistant coach, has been impressed by Perez since his £17 million arrival from Deportivo La Coruna last summer.

The 28-year-old scored seven goals in his first 12 appearances for the Gunners but has found game time harder to come by in recent months.

"I think we should keep him," Adams told The Sun. "He's a top player and he's only going to get better. He suits our style of play."

Adams also paid tribute to veteran midfielder Santi Cazorla, who is out of contract at the end of the season.

"He's been an absolutely massive player for us and I'm really sad that he might be leaving," Adams said of Cazorla. "But he's got a lot of offers on the table and I'm sure he'll make a decision soon."

#  Is slot machine in portia's future at Arsenal under threat?

When Unai Emery was appointed as the new manager of Arsenal, there were a lot of questions about who he would bring in to the team, and what his plans were for the future of the club.

One of the players who has been in the spotlight since Emery's arrival is Alex Iwobi, who has been given a new role in the team under the new manager.

Iwobi started his career at Arsenal as a striker, but has since been moved out to the wing, where he has enjoyed more success.

However, some reports have suggested that Iwobi's place in the team is now under threat, withEmery said to be considering signing a new striker in January.

One player who has been linked with a move to Arsenal is Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, who could be available for around £100 million.

Dembele joined Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund last year for an initial fee of £95 million, but he has failed to live up to expectations at the Catalan club.

Arsenal are said to be keen on signing Dembele, and he could be a good fit for their team, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to afford him.
