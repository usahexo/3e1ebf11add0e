<h1 id="Is-Carolina-Panthers-a-good-team"><a href="#Is-Carolina-Panthers-a-good-team" class="headerlink" title="Is Carolina Panthers a good team?"></a>Is Carolina Panthers a good team?</h1><p>There is no definite answer to whether or not the Carolina Panthers are a good team. Some people believe they are, while others think they still have some work to do. The Panthers had an up-and-down season in 2016, which could be indicative of whether or not they are destined for greatness this year.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons the Carolina Panthers may have had an inconsistent season last year was due to their lack of rushing attack. This year, the team made a few key acquisitions on the offensive line, which should help improve their performance in this area. Additionally, Christian McCaffrey was drafted by the Panthers in April and is anticipated to make a big impact as a rookie running back. Carolina’s offense should be much more potent this season, which will help them win more games.</p>
<p>On the defensive side of the ball, Carolina has some talented players who are capable of making big plays. Star linebacker Luke Kuechly is one such player who is always around the ball and makes a lot of tackles. His presence alone can help intimidate opponents and give Carolina an edge on defense.</p>
<p>Although there are some good players on the Panthers roster, they will need to play well as a team if they want to make it deep into the playoffs this year. If everyone can buy into Coach Ron Rivera’s system and execute properly, then Carolina has a good chance of being successful in 2017.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-goals-has-Sergio-Aguero-scored-for-Manchester-City-F-C"><a href="#How-many-goals-has-Sergio-Aguero-scored-for-Manchester-City-F-C" class="headerlink" title="How many goals has Sergio Aguero scored for Manchester City F.C.?"></a>How many goals has Sergio Aguero scored for Manchester City F.C.?</h1><p>Since he first joined Manchester City in 2011, Argentine striker Sergio Aguero has scored an impressive 176 goals across all competitions. This makes him the club’s all-time record goal scorer, and he is also the sixth-highest scorer in Premier League history.</p>
<p>Aguero’s scoring record for Manchester City is particularly impressive when you consider the fact that he has had to compete with some of the world’s best forwards for a place in the starting lineup. In his eight seasons at the club, Aguero has played alongside Carlos Tevez, Edin Dzeko, and Gabriel Jesus, all of whom are accomplished goalscorers in their own right.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-Premier-League-goals-has-Sergio-Aguero-scored"><a href="#How-many-Premier-League-goals-has-Sergio-Aguero-scored" class="headerlink" title="How many Premier League goals has Sergio Aguero scored?"></a>How many Premier League goals has Sergio Aguero scored?</h1><p>In the Premier League alone, Aguero has scored 160 goals in 233 appearances. This works out at an impressive 0.69 goals per game – a statistic which only six other players can better. In terms of minutes per goal, Aguero is also up there with the very best; he scores a Premier League goal every 124 minutes on average.</p>
<h1 id="What-have-been-some-of-Sergio-Aguero’s-most-memorable-goals-for-Manchester-City"><a href="#What-have-been-some-of-Sergio-Aguero’s-most-memorable-goals-for-Manchester-City" class="headerlink" title="What have been some of Sergio Aguero’s most memorable goals for Manchester City?"></a>What have been some of Sergio Aguero’s most memorable goals for Manchester City?</h1><p>Some of Aguero’s most memorable goals for Manchester City include his stoppage-time winner against QPR in 2012, which helped to secure the club’s first league title in 44 years; his five goals against Newcastle United in 2015; and his match-winning brace against Liverpool in 2018 which sent Manchester City through to the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
