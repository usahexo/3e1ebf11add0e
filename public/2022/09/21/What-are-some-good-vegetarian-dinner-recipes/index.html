<h1 id="What-are-some-delicious-vegetarian-dinner-recipes"><a href="#What-are-some-delicious-vegetarian-dinner-recipes" class="headerlink" title="What are some delicious vegetarian dinner recipes?"></a>What are some delicious vegetarian dinner recipes?</h1><p>When it comes to vegetarian dinner recipes, there are endless options to choose from. You can make anything from a simple vegetable stir-fry to a hearty portobello mushroom burger. Here are some of our favorite recipes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vegetable Stir-Fry</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a classic and simple dish that is perfect for any night of the week. All you need is a wok or large skillet and some fresh vegetables. Our favorites include broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, and snow peas. You can use any combination of vegetables that you like, and you can also add in some protein such as tofu, tempeh, or seitan if you want something more filling.</p>
<p>To make the stir-fry, start by heating some oil in your wok or skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables and cook until they are crispy and tender, stirring frequently. Add in your desired seasonings such as soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, or chili paste. Serve with cooked rice or noodles.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Portobello Mushroom Burger</li>
</ol>
<p>Portobello mushrooms make a great vegetarian burger patty because they are meaty and firm enough to hold up well when cooked. For this recipe, we marinate the mushrooms in balsamic vinegar and olive oil before cooking them on the grill or in a skillet. We then top them with melted cheese, fresh tomatoes, avocado slices, and grilled onions. You could also add other toppings such as lettuce or pickles if you want.</p>
<p>If you are cooking the burgers on the grill, we recommend using a Grill Mate to help prevent them from sticking. You can also cook them in a skillet over medium heat if you prefer. Serve with buns or bread rolls and your favorite condiments such as ketchup or mustard.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Quinoa Burrito Bowls</li>
</ol>
<p> quinoa makes a great base for burrito bowls because it is filling and nutritious. You can customize your bowl however you like by adding any of your favorite toppings. Our favorites include black beans, corn salsa, shredded cheese, avocado slices, cilantro lime sauce, and sour cream.</p>
<p>To make the quinoa burrito bowls, start by cooking the quinoa according to package instructions. Then assemble your bowls by adding quinoa at the bottom followed by black beans, corn salsa, shredded cheese, avocado slices, cilantro lime sauce, and sour cream. Serve chilled or at room temperature for a quick and easy meal!</p>
