<h1 id="What-is-Nauru"><a href="#What-is-Nauru" class="headerlink" title="What is Nauru?"></a>What is Nauru?</h1><p>Officially known as the Republic of Nauru, Nauru is an island country located in the Central Pacific. The country consists of a single coral atoll with a surface area of just 21 square kilometers. Nauru has a population of just over 10,000 people, most of whom live in the capital city of Yaren.</p>
<p>Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian people over 3,000 years ago. The first European visitors arrived in the 18th century, and the island was claimed by Germany in 1888. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 1949, the British withdrew from their responsibilities and Nauru became an independent republic.</p>
<p>Since independence, Nauru has faced many challenges. The economy is highly dependent on phosphate mining, which has led to environmental degradation and economic instability. The government has also faced allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. In recent years, Nauru has become a major destination for refugees fleeing conflict and persecution.</p>
<h1 id="Geography"><a href="#Geography" class="headerlink" title="Geography"></a>Geography</h1><p>Nauru is located in the Central Pacific Ocean, about 2,100 kilometers east of Papua New Guinea and 910 kilometers northeast of Australia. The country consists of a single coral atoll with a surface area of just 21 square kilometers. The atoll is divided into two parts: an elevated central plateau and a surrounding coral reef. The highest point on the plateau is just 71 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The population of Nauru is just over 10,000 people, most of whom live in the capital city of Yaren. Other major settlements include Aiwo (the second largest city), Anabar (the third largest city), Buadromo (the fourth largest city), and Denigomodu (the fifth largest city). There are also several small villages scattered throughout the island.</p>
