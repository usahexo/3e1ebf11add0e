Celebrates 10-Year Anniversary!"></a>Manchester City F.C. Celebrates 10-Year Anniversary!</h1><p>It was a decade ago that Manchester City F.C. earned its spot as one of the biggest football clubs in the world. The club has come a long way since its beginnings as St. Mark’s Football Club in 1880, and it has been a remarkable journey to see them reach the heights they have today.</p>
<p>The 10-year anniversary is a celebration of all that the club has accomplished in this time. From winning Premier League titles and FA Cups to establishing themselves as one of the most popular clubs on social media, they have done it all.</p>
<p>In honor of this momentous occasion, let’s take a look back at some of their most memorable moments over the past 10 years.</p>

<p>The 2008-2009 season was an important one for Manchester City F.C., as they became a Premier League team for the first time ever. This was a major accomplishment for the club, and they worked hard to prove themselves as one of the top teams in the league. They had some great players on their roster, including Carlos Tevez, Gareth Barry, and David Silva.</p>
<p>They finished 3rd in the Premier League table that year and made it all the way to the semi-finals of the FA Cup before losing to eventual champions Chelsea F.C. It was clear that they were a club on the rise and would only continue to get better in future seasons.</p>
<p>2012-2013 Season: Earning First Premier League Title</p>

This was an amazing accomplishment for the club and its fans, and it showed that they were now among the best teams in Europe.</p>
<p>They also reached the semi-finals of the Champions League that season but ultimately lost to Spanish champions Barcelona F.C.. However, this loss did not diminish what they had accomplished earlier in the year with their Premier League title win. It was clear that Manchester City F.C was here to stay amongst Europe’s elite clubs.</p>
<p>2014-2015 Season: Second Premier League Title &amp; Asia Tour Victory</p>
<p>After coming so close to winning back-to-back titles in 2013-2014, Manchester City finally achieved their goal in 2014-2015 by winning another Premier League championship under new manager Manuel Pellegrini. This time around they had even more firepower on their team with stars like Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, and Frank Lampard leading them to victory. They also triumphed over Jürgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund side 5-1 during their Asia Tour that summer which was an impressive feat indeed!</p>
<p>2016-2017 Season: Third Premier League Title &amp; Domestic Treble Win<br>It wasn’t easy, but Manchester City eventually clinched their third Premier League championship during Pep Guardiola’s first season as manager with some brilliant football along the way . Notable players from this squad include Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané David Silva . They also completed an unprecedented domestic treble by winning The Carabao Cup , The FA Cup , and The Premier League . This capped off an incredible campaign for Manchester City and firmly established them as one of Europe’s top clubs once again .</p>

<h1 id="The-History-of-Manchester-City-F-C"><a href="#The-History-of-Manchester-City-F-C" class="headerlink" title="The History of Manchester City F.C."></a>The History of Manchester City F.C.</h1><p>Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England. The club was formed in 1880 as St. Mark’s, before becoming Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1903. The club has played at the City of Manchester Stadium since 2003, having previously played at Maine Road from 1923 to 2003.</p>
<p>The club initially competed in the Lancashire League and the Football Alliance, before becoming a founding member of the Premier League in 1992. After winning their first major trophy—the League Cup in 2004—they finished first in the Premier League in 2012, only to be relegated one season later. They were then promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt.</p>
<p>In addition to their Premier League title win in 2018, they also have a number of domestic honours, including four FA Cups, six Football League Cups and two UEFA Cups Winners’ Cups. The club also won the English championship twice in 1937 and 1968.</p>
<p>Manchester City F.C.’s roots stem from Ardwick A.F.C., which was founded as a cricket team in 1857 by John Connell and William Beastow.[1] Cricket continued to be played at the club until 1870, when football was introduced.[2] The club initially played matches against other football clubs from around Manchester,[3] but it was not until 1887 that they formally adopted the name Ardwick Association Football Club.[4] In 1892, they moved to Hyde Road.[5]</p>
<p>The team initially competed in the Lancashire League and the Football Alliance,[6] before becoming a founder member of the English Division Two (the second tier of English football) ahead of the 1890–91 season. In 1898, they moved again to Belle Vue,[7] before settling at Maine Road in 1923.[8]</p>
<p>In 1923, Manchester City were invited to become one of the twelve founder members of the new Third Division North of the Football League.[9] The invitation was accepted, and for much of their early years as a professional side they were closely associated with Yorkshire clubs such as Bradford Park Avenue (they once serviced an away fixture at Huddersfield Town on Christmas Day), Barnsley (whose ground they shared for four seasons) and Leeds United (against whom they contested an FA Cup semi-final tie). They remained in Division Two until 1965–66 season when they became champions under manager Joe Mercer – ironically beating Leeds United 5–1 on aggregate over two legs – and were promoted to Division One along with Liverpool (who would later replace Manchester City as England’s most successful club). They narrowly avoided relegation back to Division Two during their first season back among “the big boys”, but then promptly established themselves within English football’s top tier over following campaigns; finishing fifth (1971–72), sixth (1972–73) and third (1973–74) respectively during three seasons before relegation finally did catch up with them during 1976-77 campaign after finishing 6th yet again 12 points adrift of champions Liverpool who additionally progressed into semi-finals European Cup Winners’ Cup knocking out defending champions FC Bruges en route along with cup holders Bayern Munich so ending chances Mancunian side competing continental stage next season instead UEFA Cup where would had enter 3rd qualifying round meeting Valletta replacing Glasgow Rangers who crowned Scottish champions 1977 dethroning previous crowned English counterparts Liverpool considered by many observers as strongest side Europe up until mid seventies if didn’t happen off pitch strife involving Brian Clough coming Oldham Athletic manager succeeding Mercer taking charge 2 years previous disastrous start costing him his job leaving Liverpool unchallenged dominant force outbreak hooliganismMarseille final 1st leg). They bounced straight back up however by winning Division Two at their first attempt under new manager Malcolm Allison – ironically also defeating Leeds United 5–1 on aggregate over two legs – scoring 101 goals along way including 8 consecutive home wins early part season propelling them into promotion pushing Chelsea all way .[10][11][12][13]<br>After almost two decades yo-yoing between divisions 1 and 2Manager Allison led cityinstigated lavish spending on players which led earn nicknamemyriad silverwareMost notable signing 1971 Carlos Alberto brought world famous Brazilians 1970 World champion side just months after his country lifted Jules Rimet trophy fourth time being named FIFA World Playerof Yearpic related converting penalty last minutes securing victory against Newcastle united Wembley becomingEnglish league champions for first time 1967 captain Colin Bell playing every minute league campaign: though Allison’s managerial stint ended acrimoniously after falling out with Ken Knighton - midfielder brought Allison to Maine Road as coach - appointed caretaker following departure which saw team lose form leading them being relegated 1978 knighton sacked 1981 replaced tommy Docherty who achieved promotion nextseasonmanaged cityduring eight tumultuous years marked alcoholproblemsexploits wifedrugaddictionrepossessions fact Docherty’s time there still considered most successful period</p>
