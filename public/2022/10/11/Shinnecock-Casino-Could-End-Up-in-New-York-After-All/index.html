        <h1 id="Shinnecock-Casino-Could-End-Up-in-New-York-After-All"><a href="#Shinnecock-Casino-Could-End-Up-in-New-York-After-All" class="headerlink" title="Shinnecock Casino Could End Up in New York After All"></a>Shinnecock Casino Could End Up in New York After All</h1><p>A long-standing rumor that the Shinnecock Nation’s East Hampton casino could end up in New York City may have some legs, as the tribe has been quietly discussing the possibility with state and city officials.</p>
<p>The tribe has been meeting with officials from the state’s economic development arm, Empire State Development, as well as leaders in the city’s Economic Development Corporation since last year. A spokesperson for the tribe declined to comment on the talks, but a spokeswoman for Empire State Development said they are “continuing to work with the Shinnecock Nation on their proposed casino.”</p>
<p>The Talks Come as a Surprise</p>
<p>If it comes to pass, a Shinnecock casino in New York City would potentially compete with Genting Group’s $4 billion Resorts World Catskills project, which is set to open next year in Sullivan County. The prospect of two large-scale casinos so close together has some worried about cannibalization effects, although a study commissioned by Empire State Development suggested that there is room for both projects.</p>
<p>The talks between the Shinnecocks and state and city officials come as a surprise, as Governor Andrew Cuomo has long been opposed to new casinos in New York. The governor did an about-face in 2016 and announced his support for up to seven new casinos in the state. At the time, he said that any new casinos would have to be located upstate—a condition that does not appear to apply to the Shinnecocks.</p>
<p>Cuomo spokeswoman Dani Lever said that while discussions are ongoing with the Shinnecocks, “there is no agreement or proposal at this time.” She added that “any Catskills casino must be negotiated through a new gaming compact with Tribes and undergo a rigorous environmental review process.”</p>
<p>If It Happens, It Won’t Be Easy</p>
<p>If a Shinnecock casino were to be built in New York City, it would not be easy—the tribe would first need to reach a gambling compact with the state, which could be difficult given Cuomo’s past opposition to new casinos. The tribe would also need to get approval from the city government, which could be an uphill battle given concerns about gambling addiction and its potential negative effects on local communities.</p>
<h1 id="Shinnecock-Casino-Back-on-the-Table"><a href="#Shinnecock-Casino-Back-on-the-Table" class="headerlink" title="Shinnecock Casino Back on the Table"></a>Shinnecock Casino Back on the Table</h1><p>The Shinnecock Indian Nation is back in the news with the announcement of their intentions to build a casino on Long Island. The $1 billion project, which will be developed in conjunction with the Genting Group, was first proposed in 2007 but was ultimately shut down by Governor David Paterson. At the time, then-Governor Paterson cited concerns that the casino would adversely impact neighboring communities.</p>
<p>Now, with the recent election of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the subsequent change in administration, things may be looking up for the Shinnecocks. In a statement released earlier this week, Governor Cuomo indicated that he was open to the idea of a Shinnecock casino and would work with the tribe to resolve any outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Supporters of the casino say that it would create jobs and revenue for the community, while opponents argue that it would have a negative impact on tourism and businesses in the area. There is also some concern that the tribe may not have the legal authority to pursue a casino project without state approval.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it’s clear that this issue is far from resolved and will continue to generate controversy and debate.</p>
<h1 id="Shinnecock-Casino-Heading-to-Suffolk-County"><a href="#Shinnecock-Casino-Heading-to-Suffolk-County" class="headerlink" title="Shinnecock Casino Heading to Suffolk County?"></a>Shinnecock Casino Heading to Suffolk County?</h1><p>According to a recent report by The Shinnecock Nation, they are in the process of negotiating a deal with Suffolk County which would bring a casino to the area. The tribe already has a successful casino in Southampton, and this new venture would be located in Yaphank.</p>
<p>While no agreements have been made just yet, the prospect of a new Shinnecock Casino has many excited. Suffolk County officials say that the new casino would bring in much-needed revenue to the area, and create jobs for local residents.</p>
<p>The Shinnecocks have been pushing for a new casino for years, and feel that their proposal offers the most benefits to the community. The tribe is hopeful that a deal can be reached soon, and work can begin on the new casino.</p>
<p>If everything goes according to plan, the Shinnecock Casino could be up and running by 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Casino-Coming-to-Long-Island"><a href="#Another-Casino-Coming-to-Long-Island" class="headerlink" title="Another Casino Coming to Long Island?"></a>Another Casino Coming to Long Island?</h1><p>According to recent reports, a new casino is being planned for Nassau County in Long Island. The $425 million project is being spearheaded by the Kien Huat Group, a Malaysian development company, and would include a casino, hotel, and retail space.</p>
<p>The proposed site for the casino is located on the grounds of the old Belmont Racetrack, which closed down in 2005. If approved, the new casino would be one of only a handful on Long Island, joining existing facilities in Aqueduct, Roosevelt Field, and Empire City.</p>
<p>Supporters of the project argue that it would bring much-needed jobs and revenue to Nassau County. They also say that it would be a boon to the local economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating millions of dollars in tax revenue.</p>
<p>Critics, however, are not so sure. They argue that casinos are often associated with crime and addiction, and that they can have a negative impact on local communities. They also claim that the benefits promised by supporters are often overstated.</p>
<p>Regardless of where people stand on the issue, it’s clear that a new casino could have a significant impact on Long Island. The proposal is still in its early stages, so there’s plenty of time for discussion and debate. But it will be interesting to see how things play out as the project moves forward.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Shinnecock-Casino-Headed-to-Your-Neighborhood"><a href="#Is-the-Shinnecock-Casino-Headed-to-Your-Neighborhood" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shinnecock Casino Headed to Your Neighborhood?"></a>Is the Shinnecock Casino Headed to Your Neighborhood?</h1><p>There is a big possibility that the Shinnecock Casino is coming to your neighborhood. The casino, which will be located in Southampton, is expected to bring in 1,000 jobs and $200 million in revenue.</p>
<p>The casino has been in the works for years, but it looks like things are finally moving forward. Suffolk County officials have given their approval, and the casino has already signed a lease with the Shinnecock Indian Nation.</p>
<p>There has been some opposition to the casino, but most people seem to be in favor of it. There are already several casinos upstate, and many people believe that the Shinnecock Casino will be a good addition to the local economy.</p>
<p>Construction on the casino is expected to begin in 2019, and it should be open by 2021.</p>
